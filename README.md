A project developed for my college group project about
developing an advanced solution for precise tomato plant leaf disease prediction by harnessing the power of deep learning and
convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Utilizing the Inception V3 architecture within the TensorFlow and Keras frameworks, 
our algorithm aims to accurately classify various diseases affecting plant leaves. By leveraging intricate patterns and features extracted from leaf images, 
our model demonstrates robust performance in disease identification
The dataset for traning and testing the data can be found at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kfvibI4faVurSDbytqlzmAcMNtjsxkTJ.
